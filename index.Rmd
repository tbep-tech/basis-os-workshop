Welcome to the CERF 2021 open science workshop: core concepts for impactful research and resource management. Open science (OS) has been advocated as an effective approach to create reproducible, transparent, and actionable research products. However, widespread adoption among the coastal and estuarine research community has not occurred despite its perceived benefits. In the face of major challenges like global warming and sea level rise, the collaborative framework provided by OS is needed now more than ever. This workshop will cover a half-day of material introducing participants to core concepts of OS. The target audience includes anyone interested in applying OS in their own workflows as part of a larger research and resource management team.

By the end of this workshop, you should have a solid understanding of fundamental concepts in open science and how they can be applied to help bridge the research-management divide.  You will also have the skills to understand how collaborative open science tools can be used to increase efficiency and transparency, understand fundamental best practices for working with data to facilitate openness, and be able to apply these lessons within your own teams by effectively addressing barriers to adoption.
