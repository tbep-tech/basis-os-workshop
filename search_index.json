[["index.html", "Course synopsis Agenda", " Course synopsis Welcome to the CERF 2021 open science workshop: core concepts for impactful research and resource management. Open science (OS) has been advocated as an effective approach to create reproducible, transparent, and actionable research products. However, widespread adoption among the coastal and estuarine research community has not occurred despite its perceived benefits. In the face of major challenges like global warming and sea level rise, the collaborative framework provided by OS is needed now more than ever. This workshop will cover a half-day of material introducing participants to core concepts of OS. The target audience includes anyone interested in applying OS in their own workflows as part of a larger research and resource management team. For virtual participants, this workshop would require participants to have access to the internet and specific open science tools like R and GitHub. Ideally, this would be an in person workshop though virtual participation would be possible. For this workshop to be impactful, participants will be encouraged to engage in open discussion and exchange of ideas related to open science. This is accomplished best in person, though via a virtual platform like zoom working groups can be identified and used to help facilitate the exchange of open science ideas across various disciplines and professional sectors.

Essential elements of collaboration (version control, workflow management, data repositories) Tools for collaboration (Slack, Trello, Google Docs, GitHub, etc.) Exercise idea 1: in small groups, setup a shared workspace using one of the collaborative platforms Exercise idea 2: Develop a code of conduct for your group in a shared workspace "],["impact.html", "3 Open science for impactful products", " 3 Open science for impactful products Data are foundation of research that can inform management decisions, how these date are curated and delivered can make/break the impact of a project, OS principles can help What are tidy data?

Exercise idea 1: Use your shared workspace to create a data dictionary for a sample dataset Exercise idea 2: Use your shared workspace to create a metadata file for a sample dataset Exercise idea 3: Make an untidy dataset tidy, this will have to be done with a simple dataset unless we want to get into other tools like the tidyverse "],["implement.html", "4 Lowering barriers to inclusion and addressing key critiques", " 4 Lowering barriers to inclusion and addressing key critiques Learning curves/overhead associated with new the tools Fear of being open - exposure of mistakes, getting scooped, losing the competitive edge, etc. What is open to the public agency (operating in the sunshine)?
